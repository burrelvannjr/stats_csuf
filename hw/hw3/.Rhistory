#for t-test, list the dependent (interval-ratio level) variable first and the independent (discrete/categorical) variable second
#call the means for the interval/continuous variable (dependent) based on each group in the categorical variable (independent)

#t-test is a bivariate relationship between one categorical/discrete variable of two groups, and one interval/continuous variable
